I designed a graphic interface for cinema management in this program.

Also, the following features have been added to this program:

- Save: Saves genre content to a file in the current directory
- Load: Loads genre content from a file in the current directory
- Export: Saves genre content in a file by browsing in the selected directory 
- Import: Loads genre content from a file by browsing in the selected directory

Finally, to use the above features, these shortcuts have been defined:

- Save: ctrl + s
- Load: ctrl + l
- Export: ctrl + e
- Import: ctrl + i
